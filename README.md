# Market Basket Analysis Project

## Overview
This project focuses on conducting a comprehensive Market Basket Analysis using a dataset from Kaggle. The aim is to uncover patterns and associations between different products in retail transactions. Insights from this analysis can be pivotal for strategic decision-making in retail management, including inventory planning, cross-selling strategies, and customer purchase behavior understanding.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. It consists of transactional data from a retail setting, providing a rich ground for extracting meaningful associations between products.

## Objectives
- To perform exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset's characteristics.
- To apply association rule learning to discover frequent itemsets.
- To generate and analyze rules that indicate products frequently purchased together.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Data Analysis**: Python (Pandas, NumPy)
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Market Basket Analysis**: MLxtend library for generating association rules

## Structure
- `DataExploration.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing exploratory data analysis.
- `MarketBasketAnalysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with the implementation of market basket analysis.
- `visualizations/`: Directory containing graphical representations of data and results.
- `README.md`: Project description and summary of findings.
